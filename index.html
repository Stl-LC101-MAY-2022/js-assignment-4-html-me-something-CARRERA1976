         "I love some good old Kentucky Bourbon, and I've always wanted to lay eyes on the famous Corvette 
       Museum, so I decided to take a trip SouthFounded by pioneers in 1798, Bowling Green was the provisional 
       capital of Confederate Kentucky during the American Civil War. In the 21st century, it is the location 
       of numerous manufacturers, including General Motors, Spalding, and Fruit of the Loom. The Bowling Green 
       Assembly Plant has been the source of all Chevrolet Corvettes built since 1981. Bowling Green is also 
       home to Western Kentucky University and the National Corvette Museum. However, one of the most exciting 
       places in B.G. is the historical College Street Bridge. The original College Street Bridge, which, 
       during the Civil War, was a vital means of entering the city, was up by 1860 but was burned to the 
       ground by southern rebels as they overtook the city in 1862."

      "The second on the list is the place that I was born, Memphis, Tennessee. The first European explorer 
    to visit the area of present-day Memphis was Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1541. The high 
    Chickasaw Bluffs protecting the location from the waters of the Mississippi was contested by Spanish,
    French, and English colonizers as Memphis developed. By 1819, when modern Memphis was founded, it was 
    part of United States territory. John Overton, James Winchester, and Andrew Jackson founded the city. 
    Aside from being the home of the Memphis Grizzlies, Memphis is a very rich source of history and 
    culture. From the World Famous Beale street musical district, to the newly redesigned Riverfront Landing. "

       "Next we have the little city in Missippi in which my mother was born, Tupelo. Tupelo has a deep 
     connection to Mississippi's music history, being known as the birthplace of Elvis Presley and Diplo 
     as well as the origin of the group Rae Sremmurd. The city is home to multiple art and cultural insti-
     tutions, including the Elvis Presley Birthplace. Fun fact: The last known bank robbery by Machine Gun 
     Kelly, a Prohibition-era gangster, took place on November 30, 1932, at the Citizen's State Bank in 
     Tupelo; his gang netted $38,000 ($755,000 in current dollar terms)."

       "As to the last destination on the list, I actually have no connection whatsoever. I was very close 
     to relocating here once upon a time, therefore, I saw it only fit to see what I passed up on! For 
     starters, it was the city of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which was a pivotol in the Southern Civil 
     Rights Movement. Actually, Martin Luther King, Jr. preached at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, a 
     hub for the Montgomery bus boycott! Just East of Downtown Montgomery, is the Montgomery Museum of 
     Fine Arts displays porcelain and American and African art.
